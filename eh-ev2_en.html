In this exhibition you'd notice instead of using the artist's signature way of working , she chose something different from usual , no braised pork rice : no porcelain bowl in display？！ now we finally have the chance to be in the creators working scene ! from collecting materiels to the making of porcelain bowls , a most direct way , to feel the relationship we have with Earth itself.

		  <h3>♦ About workshop</h3>
		  <p>In the edge of our word there is a s filled up with waste materials , most people that survives , lives here on this flat land. <br><br>
Because money will be useless in the future word, only gold and silver are the circulate currency ,they dig waist materials from the ground and exchange to daily necessities ; build houses  with driftwood by the ocean , oil is used up , only bicycles to transfer to places. Theres a funnel standing up tall and strait , uses ocean current generation in the far , exhausting numerous fresh air . Future word can only rely on this huge funnel to circulate oxygen emission .     <br><br>
I digged a few bags of dirt here but no trace of fortune found ：utensils from primitive man, there were bowls ,cups and plates , human kind learned how to use fire to make pottery , the New Stone Age , cinder rock pieces are the result of their civilization , brilliant ceramic technology ,and they mark their own signature sign on the utensils. , what makes people astonish is the colors on theses prehistoric utensils that glaze like glass. <br><br>
What made Prehistorical word the way it is !!!! lets produce the products of the rest of the human civilization back to the future.
